    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in `def undistorT(imgorg)` function. I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection. I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",

    "I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image. I made thrshold in two levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I computed the gradiant of gray image of the frame in respective x & y. Also, graduate magnitude was calculated and minimum threshold was applied as in the function `SobelThr(img,n)`. The ouput binary Image segmented the Lane clearly in good lighting condition but with some noise in distorted frame with high lightness.\n",
